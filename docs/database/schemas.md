Overview
This warehouse system is composed of two primary microservices:
- Orders Service: Handles order creation, persistence, and status management.
- Inventory Service: Manages item reservations and stock validation.
- API Gateway: Routes client requests to the appropriate service.
All services expose RESTful APIs with JSON payloads.
